curl http://localhost:8000/

# Expected: {"message": "Smart Resume Screener API running"}

# 2. Get all resumes
curl http://localhost:8000/api/resumes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Stats button not visible
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
3. Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check if Vite dev server is running

### Issue: Modal opens but shows loading forever
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify backend is running on port 8000
3. Check CORS configuration in `main.py`
4. Test endpoint manually with curl

### Issue: Modal shows empty state despite having scores
**Solution:**
1. Check resume_id in API call
2. Verify scores exist in database
3. Check MongoDB connection

### Issue: Progress bars not showing
**Solution:**
1. Check if score values are numbers (not strings)
2. Verify Tailwind CSS is loaded

## 📝 Post-Deployment

### Database Verification
```python
# Run this in Python to verify data structure
from database import get_database

db = get_database()

# Check resumes
resumes = list(db.resumes.find().limit(1))
print("Sample Resume:", resumes[0] if resumes else "No resumes")

# Check scores
scores = list(db.scores.find().limit(1))
print("Sample Score:", scores[0] if scores else "No scores")

# Verify resume_id linkage
if scores and resumes:
    resume_id = resumes[0]["_id"]
    linked_scores = db.scores.find({"resume_id": str(resume_id)})
    print(f"Scores for resume: {linked_scores.count()}")
```

### Performance Check
```python
import time
from database import get_resume_scores

# Test query performance
start = time.time()
scores = get_resume_scores("some_resume_id")
end = time.time()

print(f"Query took: {(end-start)*1000:.2f}ms")
# Should be < 100ms for reasonable data size
```
